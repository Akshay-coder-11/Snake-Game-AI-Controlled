Snake Game with Hand Tracking 🎮✋
This project is a Snake Game controlled using Hand Tracking. The game utilizes OpenCV, MediaPipe, and PyGame to enable interaction through hand gestures.

Features ✨
Hand Gesture Control: Move the snake using hand movements.
Real-Time Tracking: Uses MediaPipe for accurate hand detection.
Classic Snake Mechanics: Collect food to grow longer.
Interactive & Fun: Engaging gameplay with an innovative control method.
Technologies Used 🛠️
Python 🐍
OpenCV 📷 (For camera input and image processing)
MediaPipe 🖐 (For hand tracking)
PyGame 🎮 (For game development)
Installation & Setup 🏗️
1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/dkpython7/snake-game.git
cd snake-game-hand-tracking
2. Install Dependencies
pip install opencv-python mediapipe pygame numpy
3. Run the Game
python snake_game.py
How It Works? 🤔
The camera detects your hand movements.
The index finger position controls the direction of the snake.
The snake grows when it eats food.
The game ends if the snake collides with itself or the screen boundaries.
